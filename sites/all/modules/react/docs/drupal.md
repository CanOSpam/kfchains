## Headless Lightning Drupal Application

This instance of the Headless Lightning Drupal application offers multiple content types for testing with the React Starter Kit, in addition to basic configuration to quickly standup the site locally. Each of the content types is created to test various scenarios with the React application directly or sourced from the GraphQL application. Additional documentation is provided for each configuration topic noted below.
